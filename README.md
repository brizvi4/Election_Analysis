# County Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

Tom and Seth asked for my help to submit the election audit results to the election commission. They gave me a csv file containing ballot ID's, county names and candidade names. For this task, I was asked to use Python to extract meaningful information from the available data. I had to extract the following information:

- Find out the total votes casted in this election
- The number of votes casted in each county along with their percentages
- The largest county turnover
- Number of votes each candidate won and their percentages
- Winner of the election

## Election Results

By using my coding knowledge, I printed out the results on the terminal. After this, I printed out the results to a text file called election_analysis_txt. The following information was displayed in the text file:

- A total of 369,711 votes were casted in the election

## Election Audit Summary

A good advantage of this Python code is that it can be used for other elections as well.
